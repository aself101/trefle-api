ADDITIONAL SILLY CLAUSE:

By using this software, you agree to:
- Generate at least one image of a cat wearing sunglasses (optional but encouraged)
- Not blame the AI when it gives your astronaut six fingers
- Accept that "professional quality" is subjective and sometimes means "professionally weird"
- Understand that image generation is 10% prompt engineering, 90% luck
- Share your best AI fails with friends for entertainment purposes
- Remember: there are no bugs, only "creative interpretations"

If you find this software useful, consider:
- Starring the repo ⭐
- Generating something ridiculous and sharing it
- Teaching a robot to paint (they're trying their best)
- Not asking the AI to generate "photorealistic" images of impossible things
  (it will try anyway and you'll love it)

This license was generated by a human who was definitely not procrastinating.
The silliness is mandatory. The code is free. The results are unpredictable.

Enjoy responsibly (or irresponsibly, we're not your parents).
